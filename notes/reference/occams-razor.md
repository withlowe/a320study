# Occam's Razor

Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.

## Overview

Occam's Razor is a problem-solving principle that suggests when presented with competing hypotheses about the same prediction, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions.

In design and development, this translates to keeping solutions as simple as possible and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## Key Principles

* Simpler explanations are more likely to be correct
* Unnecessary complexity should be eliminated
* Additional features should justify their complexity

## Application in Design

1. Start with the simplest possible solution
2. Add complexity only when necessary
3. Question every element and feature
4. Eliminate redundant or unnecessary components

## Decision Framework

| Consideration | Questions to Ask |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Necessity | Is this element/feature essential? |
| Redundancy | Does this duplicate functionality elsewhere? |
| Complexity Cost | Does the value outweigh the added complexity? |
| Assumptions | How many assumptions does this solution require? |
| Maintenance | How difficult will this be to maintain? |
