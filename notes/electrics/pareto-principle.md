# Pareto Principle

The Pareto principle states that, for many outcomes, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

## Overview

The Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, is named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto. It suggests that 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes.

In business and design, this principle helps prioritize efforts by focusing on the vital few factors that produce the majority of results.

## Applications

* **Product Design**: 80% of users use 20% of features
* **Business**: 80% of profits come from 20% of customers
* **Project Management**: 80% of results come from 20% of effort
* **User Experience**: 80% of user interactions occur in 20% of the interface

## Implementation Strategy

1. Identify the vital 20% through data analysis
2. Prioritize resources toward these high-impact areas
3. Optimize the most-used features or touchpoints
4. Consider removing or simplifying the rarely-used 80%

## Examples

| Domain | The Critical 20% | The Other 80% |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| E-commerce | Top-selling products | Long-tail inventory |
| Content | Most-viewed pages | Rarely accessed content |
| Features | Core functionality | Nice-to-have options |
| Navigation | Primary pathways | Secondary routes |
