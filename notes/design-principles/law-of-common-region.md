# Law of Common Region

Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.

## Overview

The Law of Common Region is another Gestalt principle that states that elements tend to be perceived as grouped together if they are located within the same bounded area.

This principle is commonly applied in interface design through the use of cards, panels, and other containers to group related information.

## Design Applications

* Group related content in cards or panels
* Use borders, backgrounds, or white space to define regions
* Create visual hierarchy through nested regions
* Separate unrelated content into distinct regions

## Implementation Techniques

1. Use subtle backgrounds to define regions
2. Apply consistent spacing within and between regions
3. Consider using borders or shadows to reinforce boundaries
4. Ensure sufficient contrast between regions

## Examples

| UI Component | Implementation | Effect |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------ |
| Dashboard | Cards for different data sets | Clear separation of information |
| Form | Fieldsets with related inputs | Logical grouping of form fields |
| Navigation | Dropdown menus with boundaries | Distinction between navigation levels |
| Content | Sidebars vs. main content area | Clear functional separation |
