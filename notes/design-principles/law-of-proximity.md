# Law of Proximity

Objects that are near each other tend to be perceived as a group.

## Overview

The Law of Proximity is one of the Gestalt principles of perception. It states that elements that are close together tend to be perceived as a single group or pattern, even if the elements differ in shape, color, or size.

This principle is widely used in user interface design to create visual hierarchies and organize information.

## Examples

* Navigation menus with items grouped by function
* Form fields with labels positioned close to their inputs
* Related content grouped in cards or panels

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Group related items closer together
2. Separate unrelated items with more space
3. Use consistent spacing within groups
4. Consider proximity in relation to other visual principles

## Comparison with Other Principles

| Principle | Main Focus | When to Use |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Proximity | Spatial relationships | Grouping related items |
| Similarity | Visual appearance | Creating patterns and categories |
| Continuity | Visual flow | Guiding attention along a path |
| Closure | Completing shapes | Simplifying complex visuals |
