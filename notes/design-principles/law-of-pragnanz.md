---# Law of Prägnanz

People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it requires the least cognitive effort.

## Overview

The Law of Prägnanz (also known as the Law of Good Figure or Law of Simplicity) is the fundamental principle of Gestalt psychology. It states that when presented with a set of ambiguous or complex elements, people will tend to interpret them in the simplest way possible.

This principle explains why we often see simple shapes in complex patterns and why minimalist designs are often more effective.

## Key Aspects

* The brain prefers simple, orderly, symmetrical designs
* Complex information is mentally reduced to the simplest form
* Influences how we perceive and remember visual information

## Design Applications

1. Simplify complex information
2. Use clear, recognizable shapes and icons
3. Remove unnecessary visual elements
4. Create balanced, symmetrical layouts when possible

## Examples

| Design Element | Complex Version | Simplified Version |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Logo | Detailed illustration | Simple geometric shape |
| Navigation | Deep nested menus | Flat, organized structure |
| Data Visualization | Raw data tables | Charts and graphs |
| Instructions | Lengthy text | Step-by-step visuals |
