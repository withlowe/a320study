# Hick's Law

The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.

## Overview

Hick's Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a function of the number of possible choices they have.

This principle is crucial in user interface design, suggesting that reducing the number of options can lead to faster decision-making and better user experiences.

## Mathematical Formula

T = b logâ‚‚(n + 1)

Where:
* T is the decision time
* b is an empirical constant
* n is the number of choices

## Design Applications

1. Limit the number of navigation options
2. Break complex processes into steps
3. Use progressive disclosure to reveal options as needed
4. Group similar options into categories

## Examples

| UI Element | Poor Implementation | Better Implementation |
| ---------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Navigation | 15+ top-level items | 5-7 main categories |
| Settings | All options at once | Categorized settings |
| Product Selection | Overwhelming grid | Filtered/faceted browsing |
| Forms | All fields visible | Progressive disclosure |
