# Jakob's Law

Users spend most of their time on other sites, so they prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

## Overview

Jakob's Law, named after usability expert Jakob Nielsen, states that users develop expectations for how interfaces should work based on their cumulative experiences with other interfaces.

This principle suggests that following established design patterns can lead to better usability and user satisfaction.

## Key Implications

* Users transfer expectations from one digital product to another
* Familiar patterns reduce cognitive load
* Innovation should be balanced with convention

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Research common patterns in your industry
2. Follow established conventions for core functionality
3. Innovate primarily in your unique value proposition
4. Test deviations from conventions with users

## Common Design Patterns

| Element | Conventional Pattern | Why It Works |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| Navigation | Horizontal menu at top | Users expect to find navigation here |
| Search | Right-aligned field with magnifying glass icon | Widely recognized pattern |
| Shopping Cart | Top right with cart icon | Consistent across e-commerce |
| Form Submission | Primary button at bottom right | Follows reading/task flow |
